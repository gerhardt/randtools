check_bin_01.nb - checks the same files for singles and tuples as the C-coder
		  compares to getslices.c

gen_rand_01.nb  - generates a bin file (8 random bits per byte), which is 
		  perfectly balanced (50:50 0:1, 25:25:25:25 tuples). Slow
                  for big files!

read_binary_formats_01.nb
		- reads all kinds of input format, which are derived from the 
		  timetagger files, generated by python etc.
